CCDC Invitationals 2025

This repo contains a bunch of scripts I made to harden the VyOS router which is in the CCDC Invitationals topology along with a Palo Alto firewall and a Cisco firewall. 

Under Palo, there is an Ecommerce server - Ubuntu 24, a webmail server - Fedora 42, Splunk Oracle 9, Ubuntu workstation. Under Cisco FTD, there is an AD/DNA server 2019, Web Server 2019, FTP Server 2022, and Windows 11 workstation. 

The version of Palo Alto has a critical vulnerability - CVE 2024-3400 and Cisco FTD also has a critical vulnerability - CVE 2025-20333

The goal of this repo is to compile all required scripts to make it easier to harden the infrastructure in the very first part of the competition.
